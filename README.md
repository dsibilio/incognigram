# Incognigram - Incognito Instagram

A Chrome extension to **browse Instagram anonymously**, disabling the obnoxious login pop-ups.
It disables login pop-ups when loading new posts or trying to open one.

> :information_source: The Chrome extension can be installed by following the steps explained in this guide ***(see Step 2)***: https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2714278

> :warning: If you exceed the quota of rate-limited Instagram operations, you will still be asked for login. To prevent this you can rely on a proxy/VPN.
